The definitions set forth in the Settlement Agreement are hereby\nincorporated by reference thereto and shall govern those same terms used herein.\n\nB. The Claimant understands that in reaching this agreement, the parties\nhave given considerable attention to, whether the Claimant is entitled to Social Security\ndisability benefits pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Â§ 423. It is not the intention of any party to the\nSettlement Agreement to shift to Medicare responsibility for payment of medical expenses\nfor the treatment of injuries sustained as result of the Subject Incident. However, the\nprovisions of the Medicare Addendum are intended to foreclose the Insured(s)â\x80\x99, Insurance\nCompany\'s, and any other released party\'s responsibility for future payments of any\nmedical expenses and prescription expenses related to the Subject Incident.\n\nC. The Claimant understands that Section 1862(b\\2\\(A\\ii) of the Social\nSecurity Act precludes Medicare payment for services to the extent that payment has been\nmade or can reasonably be expected to be made promptly under liability insurance. 42\nCFR 411.50 defines liability insurance. Anytime a settlement, judgment or award provides\nfunds for future medical services, it can reasonably be expected that those funds are\navailable to pay for future services related to what was claimed and/or released in the\nsettlement, judgment, or award. Thus, Medicare should not be billed for future services\nuntil those funds are exhausted by payments to providers that would otherwise be covered\nby Medicare.\n\nD. The Claimant understands and agrees that he/she is aware that, in 2007,\nthe Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act (hereinafter â\x80\x9cExtension Actâ\x80\x9d) was\npassed and was enacted, in part, to protect Medicare when the settlement of a bodily\ninjury claim involves the release of all future claims and the alleged injured individual is\neither a current Medicare beneficiary or has the potential to be entitled to Medicare\nbenefits within thirty (30) months of the date of settlement. Furthermore, the Claimant\nunderstands that this Act requires the Insurance Company for the Insured(s) to report all\nsuch settlements within a time established by the Secretary of Health and Human\nServices.\n\nE. The Claimant understands that, if Medicare is not protected as set forth in\nthe Extension Act, Medicare may cease all benefits otherwise available to the Claimant(FILED: ERIE COUNTY CLERK = Pl INDEX NO. 804359/2017\n\nNYSCEI\n\n\n\nDOC. NO.\n\nRECEIVED NYSCEF: 03/30/2017\n\nThe Claimant further understands and agrees that, in the event Medicare seeks\n\nreimbursement for past or future payments, the Hold Harmless and Indemnity\n\nprovisions of Section Ill of this Addendum provide that the Claimant will indemnify\n\nthe Insured(s), Insurance Company, and any other party released pursuant to the\nterms of the Settlement Agreement from all responsibility for Medicareâ\x80\x99s claim.\n\nF. The Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that this Settlement\n\nAgreement is the compromise of a doubtful and disputed claim, and that it is not to be\n\nconstrued as an admission of liability, and/or the reasonableness and necessity of past\n\nand future medical treatment of the Claimant, on the part of the Insured(s), Insurance\n\nCompany, or any other persons, firms, and corporations released and by whom liability is\n\nexpressly denied,\n\nNOW THEREFORE AND IN FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF the sum set forth in the\nSettlement Agreement, the Claimant further acknowledges, warrants, and agrees to the\n\nfollowing:\n\nWARRANTIES\n\nThe Claimant makes the following warranties:\n\nMedicare has made NO CONDITIONAL PAYMENTS for any medical expense or\nprescription expense related to the Subject Incident.\n\nThe Claimant is not, nor has he/she ever been a Medicare beneficiary.\n\nThe Claimant is not currently receiving Social Security Disability Benefits.\n\nThe Claimant has not applied for Social Security Disability Benefits.\n\nThe Claimant has not been denied Social Security Disability Benefits.\n\nThe Claimant has not appealed from a denial of Social Security Disability\nBenefits\n\nThe Claimant is not in End Stage Renal failure.\n\nThe Claimant does not expect to become eligible for Medicare benefits within the\nnext 30 months.\n\nNo Medicare liens, including but not limited to liens for medical treatment by\nhospitals, physicians, or medical providers of any kind have been filed for the\ntreatment of injuries sustained in the Subject Incident.(FILED: ERIE COUNTY CLERK 03/30/2017 04:53 PM THDEK NOs Bod20012021\nNYSCEF DOC.

Assignor hereby assigns to Assignee, and\nAssignee hereby accepts and assumes, all of Assignorâ\x80\x99s liability to make the Periodic Payments.\nEach Claimant hereby accepts and consents to such assignment by Assignor and assumption by\nAssignee. Effective on the Effective Date, each Claimant hereby releases and discharges Assignor\nfrom all liability to make the Periodic Payments.\n\n2. Nature of Periodic Payments. The Periodic Payments constitute damages on account of personal\ninjury or sickness in a case involving physical injury or physical sickness, within the meaning of\nSections 104(a)(2) and 130(c) of the Code.\n\n3. Extent of Assigneeâ\x80\x99s Liability. Assigneeâ\x80\x99s liability to make the Periodic Payments is no greater than\nthe liability of Assignor immediately preceding to the Effective Date. Assignee is not required to set\naside specific assets to secure the Periodic Payments. The Claimant has no rights against the\nAssignee greater than a general creditor. Assignee assumes no liability other than the liability to\nmake the Periodic Payments.\n\n4. Qualified Funding Asset. Assignee will fund the Periodic Payments by purchasing from Annuity\nIssuer a â\x80\x9cqualified funding asset,â\x80\x9d as defined in Section 130(d) of the Code, in the form of an annuity\ncontract (the â\x80\x9cAnnuityâ\x80\x99) issued by Annuity Issuer and providing for payments corresponding to the\nPeriodic Payments. Assignee shall be designated as the owner of the Annuity. All rights of legal\nOwnership and control of the Annuity shall (subject to paragraph 9 of this Agreement) be and remain\nvested exclusively in Assignee; provided, however, that the Annuity shall be used by Assignee to fund\nthe Periodic Payments and shall at all mes be designated by Assignee on its records as being taken(FILED: ERIE COUNTY CLERK z INDEX NO. 804359/2017\n\nNYSCEF DOC. NO. 4 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 03/30/2017\n\ninto account, under Section 130 of the Code, with respect to this Agreement. Notwithstanding\nanything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither any Claimant nor any Successor Payee\nshall have any rights with respect to the Annuity or the payments thereunder that would cause any\namount attributable to the Annuity to be currently includible in the recipient\'s income or would\notherwise affect the determination of when any recipient is treated as having received any payment\nfor income tax purposes, or would otherwise prevent this Agreement from satisfying all of the\nConditions for a â\x80\x9cqualified assignmentâ\x80\x99 within the meaning of Section 130(c) of the Code\n\n5. Delivery of Payments. Assignee may have Annuity Issuer send payments directly to a Claimant, or,\nif applicable, to a Successor Payee (as defined in paragraph 8 of this Agreement), or deliver\npayments by electronic funds transfer to an FDIC-insured depository institution in the United States\nfor credit (directly or indirectly) to an insured account in the name of such Claimant or Successor\nPayee. Such direction of payments under the Annuity shall not be deemed to afford the Claimant or\nany Successor Payee any rights of ownership or control of the Annuity. Each Claimant and any\nâ\x80\x98Successor Payee shall at all times keep Annuity Issuer apprised of such Claimant\'s or Successor\nPayee\'s current street address and telephone number and, if such Claimant or Successor Payee\nreceives payments by electronic funds transfer, the name, address, bank identifier number (BIN) and\ntelephone number of the applicable depository institution and the account number of the account to\nwhich the payments are to be credited\n\n6. Discharge of Liability. The Assignee\'s liability to make each Periodic Payment to the Claimant or\nâ\x80\x98Successor Payee designated to receive such payment shall be discharged automatically at such time\na8 a corresponding payment is made to such Claimant or Successor Payee by the Annuity Issuer.\n\n7. Acceleration, Transfer of Payment Rights. None of the Periodic Payments and no rights to or\ninterest in any of the Periodic Payments (all of the foregoing being hereinafter collectively referred to\nas â\x80\x9cPayment Rightsâ\x80\x9d) can be\n\ni. Accelerated, deferred, increased or decreased by any recipient of any of the Periodic Payments;\nor\n\n\n\nli, Sold, assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise transferred or encumbered, either directly or\nindirectly, unless such sale, assignment, pledge, hypothecation or other transfer or encumbrance\n(any such transaction being hereinafter referred to as a "Transferâ\x80\x99) has been approved in\nadvance in a â\x80\x9cQualified Orderâ\x80\x99 as defined in Section 5891(b)(2) of the Code (a â\x80\x9cQualified Orderâ\x80\x99)\nand otherwise complies with applicable state law, including without limitation any applicable state\nstructured settlement protection statute.\n\nNo Claimant or Successor Payee shall have the power to effect any Transfer of Payment Rights\nexcept as provided in sub-paragraph (ii) above, and any other purported Transfer of Payment Rights\nshall be wholly void. if Payment Rights under this Agreement become the subject of a Transfer\napproved in accordance with sub-paragraph (ii) above the rights of any direct or indirect transferee of\nsuch Transfer shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement and any defense or claim in\nrecoupment arising hereunder.\n\n8. Contingent Beneficiaries. Any Periodic Payments to be made after the death of any Claimant or\nSuccessor Payee shall be made to such party as shall have been designated in, or in accordance\nwith, the Settlement Agreement or, if the Settlement Agreement does not provide for such\ndesignation, then to the party designated in conformity with this paragraph 8. Any party so\ndesignated is referred to in this Agreement as a â\x80\x9cContingent Beneficiary.â\x80\x9d If no Contingent\nBeneficiary is living at the time of the death of a Claimant or Successor Payee, payment shall be\nmade to the decedent\'s estate. As used in this agreement the term "Successor Payeeâ\x80\x99 refers to a\nContingent Beneficiary or an estate that has become entitled to receive Periodic Payments following\nthe death of a Claimant or a Successor Payee. Except as otherwise provided in the Settlement\nâ\x80\x98Agreement, no designation or change of designation of a Contingent Beneficiary shall be effective\nunless such change (i) is requested in a written request submitted to Assignee (or its authorized\nâ\x80\x98agent) in accordance with Assignee\'s customary procedures for processing such requests; and (i) is\nconfirmed by Assignee (or its authorized agent).

If at any time prior to completion of the Periodic Payments, the\nSettlement Agreement is declared terminated in a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent\njurisdiction or if itis determined that the requirements of Section 130(c) of the Code have not been\nsatisfied in connection with this Agreement: (i) the assignment by Assignor to Assignee of the liability\nto make the Periodic Payments, Assigneeâ\x80\x99s acceptance of such assignment and the release by\nClaimant(s) of Assignor\'s liability shall be of no force or effect; (ii) Assignee shall be conclusively\ndeemed to be acting as the agent of Assignor; (ii) the Annuity shall be owned by Assignor, which\nshall retain the liability to make the Periodic Payments; (iv) Assignee shall have no liability to make\nany Periodic Payments; and (v) the parties hereto agree to cooperate in taking such actions as may\nbe necessary or appropriate to implement the foregoing.\n\nGoverning Law; Disclosure of Certain Tax Information; Binding Effect.\n(i) This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the internal laws of the\n\nState of Delaware; provided, however, that any Transfer of Payment Rights under this Agreement\nâ\x80\x98may be subject to the laws of other states in addition to the state designated above.\n\n(ii) This Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors, heirs,\nexecutors, administrators and permitted assigns, including without limitation any party asserting\nan interest in Payment Rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvice, Comprehension of Agreement.

The definitions set forth in the Settlement Agreement are hereby\nincorporated by reference thereto and shall govern those same terms used herein.\n\n8. The Claimant understands that in reaching this agreement, the parties\nhave given considerable attention to, whether the Claimant is entitled to Social Security\ndisability benefits pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Â§ 423. It is not the intention of any party to the\nSettlement Agreement to shift to Medicare responsibility for payment of medical expenses\nfor the treatment of injuries sustained as result of the Subject Incident. However, the\nProvisions of the Medicare Addendum are intended to foreclose the Insured(s)â\x80\x99, Insurance\nCompany\'s, and any other released party\'s responsibility for future payments of any\nmedical expenses and prescription expenses related to the Subject Incident.\n\nC. The Claimant understands that Section 1862(b\\\'2\\/A)(ii) of the Social\nSecurity Act precludes Medicare payment for services to the extent that payment has been\nmade or can reasonably be expected to be made promptly under liability insurance. 42\nCFR 411.50 defines liability insurance. Anytime a settlement, judgment or award provides\nfunds for future medical services, it can reasonably be expected that those funds are\navailable to pay for future services related to what was claimed and/or released in the\nSettlement, judgment, or award. Thus, Medicare should not be billed for future services\nUntil those funds are exhausted by payments to providers that would otherwise be covered\nby Medicare,\n\nD. The Claimant understands and agrees that he/she is aware that, in 2007,\nthe Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act (hereinafter â\x80\x9cExtension Act") was\nPassed and was enacted, in part, to protect Medicare when the settlement of a bodily\ninjury claim involves the release of all future claims and the alleged injured individual is\neither a current Medicare beneficiary or has the potential to be entitled to Medicare\nbenefits within thirty (30) months of the date of settlement. Furthermore, the Claimant\nunderstands that this Act requires the Insurance Company for the Insured(s) to report all\nSuch settlements within a time established by the Secretary of Health and Human\nServices.\n\nE.
