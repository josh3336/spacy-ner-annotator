The definitions set forth in the Settlement Agreement are hereby\nincorporated by reference thereto and shall govern those same terms used herein.\n\nB. The Claimant understands that in reaching this agreement, the parties\nhave given considerable attention to, whether the Claimant is entitled to Social Security\ndisability benefits pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Â§ 423. It is not the intention of any party to the\nSettlement Agreement to shift to Medicare responsibility for payment of medical expenses\nfor the treatment of injuries sustained as result of the Subject Incident. However, the\nprovisions of the Medicare Addendum are intended to foreclose the Insured(s)â\x80\x99, Insurance\nCompany\'s, and any other released party\'s responsibility for future payments of any\nmedical expenses and prescription expenses related to the Subject Incident.\n\nC. The Claimant understands that Section 1862(b\\2\\(A\\ii) of the Social\nSecurity Act precludes Medicare payment for services to the extent that payment has been\nmade or can reasonably be expected to be made promptly under liability insurance. 42\nCFR 411.50 defines liability insurance. Anytime a settlement, judgment or award provides\nfunds for future medical services, it can reasonably be expected that those funds are\navailable to pay for future services related to what was claimed and/or released in the\nsettlement, judgment, or award. Thus, Medicare should not be billed for future services\nuntil those funds are exhausted by payments to providers that would otherwise be covered\nby Medicare.\n\nD. The Claimant understands and agrees that he/she is aware that, in 2007,\nthe Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act (hereinafter â\x80\x9cExtension Actâ\x80\x9d) was\npassed and was enacted, in part, to protect Medicare when the settlement of a bodily\ninjury claim involves the release of all future claims and the alleged injured individual is\neither a current Medicare beneficiary or has the potential to be entitled to Medicare\nbenefits within thirty (30) months of the date of settlement. Furthermore, the Claimant\nunderstands that this Act requires the Insurance Company for the Insured(s) to report all\nsuch settlements within a time established by the Secretary of Health and Human\nServices.\n\nE. The Claimant understands that, if Medicare is not protected as set forth in\nthe Extension Act, Medicare may cease all benefits otherwise available to the Claimant(FILED: ERIE COUNTY CLERK = Pl INDEX NO. 804359/2017\n\nNYSCEI\n\n\n\nDOC. NO.\n\nRECEIVED NYSCEF: 03/30/2017\n\nThe Claimant further understands and agrees that, in the event Medicare seeks\n\nreimbursement for past or future payments, the Hold Harmless and Indemnity\n\nprovisions of Section Ill of this Addendum provide that the Claimant will indemnify\n\nthe Insured(s), Insurance Company, and any other party released pursuant to the\nterms of the Settlement Agreement from all responsibility for Medicareâ\x80\x99s claim.\n\nF. The Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that this Settlement\n\nAgreement is the compromise of a doubtful and disputed claim, and that it is not to be\n\nconstrued as an admission of liability, and/or the reasonableness and necessity of past\n\nand future medical treatment of the Claimant, on the part of the Insured(s), Insurance\n\nCompany, or any other persons, firms, and corporations released and by whom liability is\n\nexpressly denied,\n\nNOW THEREFORE AND IN FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF the sum set forth in the\nSettlement Agreement, the Claimant further acknowledges, warrants, and agrees to the\n\nfollowing:\n\nWARRANTIES\n\nThe Claimant makes the following warranties:\n\nMedicare has made NO CONDITIONAL PAYMENTS for any medical expense or\nprescription expense related to the Subject Incident.\n\nThe Claimant is not, nor has he/she ever been a Medicare beneficiary.\n\nThe Claimant is not currently receiving Social Security Disability Benefits.\n\nThe Claimant has not applied for Social Security Disability Benefits.\n\nThe Claimant has not been denied Social Security Disability Benefits.\n\nThe Claimant has not appealed from a denial of Social Security Disability\nBenefits\n\nThe Claimant is not in End Stage Renal failure.\n\nThe Claimant does not expect to become eligible for Medicare benefits within the\nnext 30 months.\n\nNo Medicare liens, including but not limited to liens for medical treatment by\nhospitals, physicians, or medical providers of any kind have been filed for the\ntreatment of injuries sustained in the Subject Incident.(FILED: ERIE COUNTY CLERK 03/30/2017 04:53 PM THDEK NOs Bod20012021\nNYSCEF DOC.

Assignor hereby assigns to Assignee, and\nAssignee hereby accepts and assumes, all of Assignorâ\x80\x99s liability to make the Periodic Payments.\nEach Claimant hereby accepts and consents to such assignment by Assignor and assumption by\nAssignee. Effective on the Effective Date, each Claimant hereby releases and discharges Assignor\nfrom all liability to make the Periodic Payments.\n\n2. Nature of Periodic Payments. The Periodic Payments constitute damages on account of personal\ninjury or sickness in a case involving physical injury or physical sickness, within the meaning of\nSections 104(a)(2) and 130(c) of the Code.\n\n3. Extent of Assigneeâ\x80\x99s Liability. Assigneeâ\x80\x99s liability to make the Periodic Payments is no greater than\nthe liability of Assignor immediately preceding to the Effective Date. Assignee is not required to set\naside specific assets to secure the Periodic Payments. The Claimant has no rights against the\nAssignee greater than a general creditor. Assignee assumes no liability other than the liability to\nmake the Periodic Payments.\n\n4. Qualified Funding Asset. Assignee will fund the Periodic Payments by purchasing from Annuity\nIssuer a â\x80\x9cqualified funding asset,â\x80\x9d as defined in Section 130(d) of the Code, in the form of an annuity\ncontract (the â\x80\x9cAnnuityâ\x80\x99) issued by Annuity Issuer and providing for payments corresponding to the\nPeriodic Payments. Assignee shall be designated as the owner of the Annuity. All rights of legal\nOwnership and control of the Annuity shall (subject to paragraph 9 of this Agreement) be and remain\nvested exclusively in Assignee; provided, however, that the Annuity shall be used by Assignee to fund\nthe Periodic Payments and shall at all mes be designated by Assignee on its records as being taken(FILED: ERIE COUNTY CLERK z INDEX NO. 804359/2017\n\nNYSCEF DOC. NO. 4 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 03/30/2017\n\ninto account, under Section 130 of the Code, with respect to this Agreement. Notwithstanding\nanything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither any Claimant nor any Successor Payee\nshall have any rights with respect to the Annuity or the payments thereunder that would cause any\namount attributable to the Annuity to be currently includible in the recipient\'s income or would\notherwise affect the determination of when any recipient is treated as having received any payment\nfor income tax purposes, or would otherwise prevent this Agreement from satisfying all of the\nConditions for a â\x80\x9cqualified assignmentâ\x80\x99 within the meaning of Section 130(c) of the Code\n\n5. Delivery of Payments. Assignee may have Annuity Issuer send payments directly to a Claimant, or,\nif applicable, to a Successor Payee (as defined in paragraph 8 of this Agreement), or deliver\npayments by electronic funds transfer to an FDIC-insured depository institution in the United States\nfor credit (directly or indirectly) to an insured account in the name of such Claimant or Successor\nPayee. Such direction of payments under the Annuity shall not be deemed to afford the Claimant or\nany Successor Payee any rights of ownership or control of the Annuity. Each Claimant and any\nâ\x80\x98Successor Payee shall at all times keep Annuity Issuer apprised of such Claimant\'s or Successor\nPayee\'s current street address and telephone number and, if such Claimant or Successor Payee\nreceives payments by electronic funds transfer, the name, address, bank identifier number (BIN) and\ntelephone number of the applicable depository institution and the account number of the account to\nwhich the payments are to be credited\n\n6. Discharge of Liability. The Assignee\'s liability to make each Periodic Payment to the Claimant or\nâ\x80\x98Successor Payee designated to receive such payment shall be discharged automatically at such time\na8 a corresponding payment is made to such Claimant or Successor Payee by the Annuity Issuer.\n\n7. Acceleration, Transfer of Payment Rights. None of the Periodic Payments and no rights to or\ninterest in any of the Periodic Payments (all of the foregoing being hereinafter collectively referred to\nas â\x80\x9cPayment Rightsâ\x80\x9d) can be\n\ni. Accelerated, deferred, increased or decreased by any recipient of any of the Periodic Payments;\nor\n\n\n\nli, Sold, assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise transferred or encumbered, either directly or\nindirectly, unless such sale, assignment, pledge, hypothecation or other transfer or encumbrance\n(any such transaction being hereinafter referred to as a "Transferâ\x80\x99) has been approved in\nadvance in a â\x80\x9cQualified Orderâ\x80\x99 as defined in Section 5891(b)(2) of the Code (a â\x80\x9cQualified Orderâ\x80\x99)\nand otherwise complies with applicable state law, including without limitation any applicable state\nstructured settlement protection statute.\n\nNo Claimant or Successor Payee shall have the power to effect any Transfer of Payment Rights\nexcept as provided in sub-paragraph (ii) above, and any other purported Transfer of Payment Rights\nshall be wholly void. if Payment Rights under this Agreement become the subject of a Transfer\napproved in accordance with sub-paragraph (ii) above the rights of any direct or indirect transferee of\nsuch Transfer shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement and any defense or claim in\nrecoupment arising hereunder.\n\n8. Contingent Beneficiaries. Any Periodic Payments to be made after the death of any Claimant or\nSuccessor Payee shall be made to such party as shall have been designated in, or in accordance\nwith, the Settlement Agreement or, if the Settlement Agreement does not provide for such\ndesignation, then to the party designated in conformity with this paragraph 8. Any party so\ndesignated is referred to in this Agreement as a â\x80\x9cContingent Beneficiary.â\x80\x9d If no Contingent\nBeneficiary is living at the time of the death of a Claimant or Successor Payee, payment shall be\nmade to the decedent\'s estate. As used in this agreement the term "Successor Payeeâ\x80\x99 refers to a\nContingent Beneficiary or an estate that has become entitled to receive Periodic Payments following\nthe death of a Claimant or a Successor Payee. Except as otherwise provided in the Settlement\nâ\x80\x98Agreement, no designation or change of designation of a Contingent Beneficiary shall be effective\nunless such change (i) is requested in a written request submitted to Assignee (or its authorized\nâ\x80\x98agent) in accordance with Assignee\'s customary procedures for processing such requests; and (i) is\nconfirmed by Assignee (or its authorized agent).

If at any time prior to completion of the Periodic Payments, the\nSettlement Agreement is declared terminated in a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent\njurisdiction or if itis determined that the requirements of Section 130(c) of the Code have not been\nsatisfied in connection with this Agreement: (i) the assignment by Assignor to Assignee of the liability\nto make the Periodic Payments, Assigneeâ\x80\x99s acceptance of such assignment and the release by\nClaimant(s) of Assignor\'s liability shall be of no force or effect; (ii) Assignee shall be conclusively\ndeemed to be acting as the agent of Assignor; (ii) the Annuity shall be owned by Assignor, which\nshall retain the liability to make the Periodic Payments; (iv) Assignee shall have no liability to make\nany Periodic Payments; and (v) the parties hereto agree to cooperate in taking such actions as may\nbe necessary or appropriate to implement the foregoing.\n\nGoverning Law; Disclosure of Certain Tax Information; Binding Effect.\n(i) This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the internal laws of the\n\nState of Delaware; provided, however, that any Transfer of Payment Rights under this Agreement\nâ\x80\x98may be subject to the laws of other states in addition to the state designated above.\n\n(ii) This Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors, heirs,\nexecutors, administrators and permitted assigns, including without limitation any party asserting\nan interest in Payment Rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvice, Comprehension of Agreement.

The definitions set forth in the Settlement Agreement are hereby\nincorporated by reference thereto and shall govern those same terms used herein.\n\n8. The Claimant understands that in reaching this agreement, the parties\nhave given considerable attention to, whether the Claimant is entitled to Social Security\ndisability benefits pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Â§ 423. It is not the intention of any party to the\nSettlement Agreement to shift to Medicare responsibility for payment of medical expenses\nfor the treatment of injuries sustained as result of the Subject Incident. However, the\nProvisions of the Medicare Addendum are intended to foreclose the Insured(s)â\x80\x99, Insurance\nCompany\'s, and any other released party\'s responsibility for future payments of any\nmedical expenses and prescription expenses related to the Subject Incident.\n\nC. The Claimant understands that Section 1862(b\\\'2\\/A)(ii) of the Social\nSecurity Act precludes Medicare payment for services to the extent that payment has been\nmade or can reasonably be expected to be made promptly under liability insurance. 42\nCFR 411.50 defines liability insurance. Anytime a settlement, judgment or award provides\nfunds for future medical services, it can reasonably be expected that those funds are\navailable to pay for future services related to what was claimed and/or released in the\nSettlement, judgment, or award. Thus, Medicare should not be billed for future services\nUntil those funds are exhausted by payments to providers that would otherwise be covered\nby Medicare,\n\nD. The Claimant understands and agrees that he/she is aware that, in 2007,\nthe Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act (hereinafter â\x80\x9cExtension Act") was\nPassed and was enacted, in part, to protect Medicare when the settlement of a bodily\ninjury claim involves the release of all future claims and the alleged injured individual is\neither a current Medicare beneficiary or has the potential to be entitled to Medicare\nbenefits within thirty (30) months of the date of settlement. Furthermore, the Claimant\nunderstands that this Act requires the Insurance Company for the Insured(s) to report all\nSuch settlements within a time established by the Secretary of Health and Human\nServices.\n\nE.

Alternatively, the funds could be\nplaced into an Annuity for a period of four (4) years, payments being made annually on July 1\nevery year, starting with the year the minor turns the age of eighteen (18). This option is further\nillustrated in the attached Exhibit â\x80\x9cA.â\x80\x9d Jennifer Hitt, Ruth Westra, and the GAL agree that the\nlatter option is in the minorsâ\x80\x99 best interests.\n\nThe GAL is satisfied that the Settlement Illustration, attached to this Report, is an\nequitable and financially sound proposal for the minors.

As\npart of that settlement, a Settlement Agreement and Release was entered (the “Settlement”)\nwhereby Peaches was to receive the following lump sum structured settlement payments: Forty\nFive Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($45,000.00) due August 8, 2004; Fifty Five Thousand and\n00/100 Dollars ($55,000.00) due August 8, 2007; Seventy Thousand and 00/100 Dollars\n\n($70,000.00) due August 8, 2010; Eighty Five Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($85,000.00) due\n\nAPPLICATION FOR APPROVAL OF TRANSFER OF STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT PAYMENT\nage 2e4a—-Oo—4673\n\nAugust 8, 2013; and One Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Four Hundred Ninety Six and 00/100\nDollars ($125,496.00) due August 8, 2016, (The payments due and payable to Peaches under the\nSettlement shall hereafter be referred to as the “Settlement Payments.”)\n\n8. In accordance with the Settlement, the obligation to make the Settlement\nPayments was assigned to and assumed by Travelers Life and Annuity Company n/k/a MetLife\nLife and Annuity Company of Connecticut (“MLAC”). TLAC then purchased an annuity,\ncontract no. 2457NW55450 (the “Annuity”), from Travelers Insurance Company n/k/a MetLife\nInsurance Company of Connecticut (“MLIC”) to fund its obligation to make the Settlement\nPayments to Peaches under the Settlement. Peaches receives her payments directly from MLIC.\n\n9. In return for the payment of a lump sum, Peaches has agreed to transfer and\n\nassign to SSC the right to receive certain of the Settlement Payments as follows:\n\n* One (1) lump sum payment of One Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Four\nHundred Ninety Six and 00/100 Dollars ($125,496.00) due August 8, 2016\n\n(The payment which is being transferred to SSC pursuant to the Transfer Agreement, as defined\nbelow, and which is the subject of this court proceeding, shall hereafter be referred to as the\n“Assigned Payment.")\n\n10. Peaches executed a Purchase, Transfer and Assignment Agreement dated on or\nabout December 5, 2008, in which she agreed to assign and transfer the Assigned Payments to\nTransferee SSC and/or its successors and assigns.

Lee, seek an order\npermitting transfer of the IP’s future structured settlement payment rights, in the amount of;\n$65,000.00 due on January 13, 2015, $95,000.00 due on January 13, 2020, and $125,000.00 due on\nJanuary 13, 2025 (hereinafter the “Periodic Payments”). Commissioner of the Department of Social\nServices of the City of New York (hereinafter, the “Department”), as first remainderman under the\nTrust, opposes. Respondents, Allstate Life Insurance Company and Allstate Settlement Corporation\n(hereinafter, “Allstate”), who are assigned the obligation to provide the Periodic Payments, neither\nsupport nor oppose the relief requested.\n\nAt oral argument on November 26, 2012, all parties appeared in the proceeding, including\nLaverne Hawkins-Lee, Trustee of the SNT, who appeared pro-se.\n\nWhile the gravaman for the requested relief is a pending foreclosure proceeding, no\ndocumentation evidencing the status of the foreclosure is annexed to the moving papers. A review\nofthe moving papers also indicates that the family residence is not in the name of the IP, but in the\nname of Ms. Hawkins-Lee and her deceased husband, Additionally, the moving papers assert that\nMs. Hawkins-Lee has outstanding debts on behalf of herself and the IP in the amount of $21,425.16.\n\nA previous application by Ms. Hawkins-Lee to invade the IP’s SNT for $30,000.00, to pay\noff debts and avoid foreclosure on the family home was granted pursuant to an Order by Judge\nMichael Ambrosio dated September 9, 2009. Thereafter Ms. Hawkins-Lee inadvertently received\n$60,000.00 [based on this application). In order to resolve the overpayment of $30,000.00, Allstate\ncurrently retains $600.00 from each monthly Periodic Payment. (see, Affidavit of Janet Dever, {’s\n\n12 & 13),\n\nPage 2 of 3Taking the record as a whole, Ms. Hawkins-Lee appears to be in a worse off position now\nthan when she was granted similar relief three years ago. With no cogent plan in place to prevent\na future financial shortfall, save invading the IP’s SNT, prudence dictates that this Court must err\nin preserving the IP’s assets to ensure that the best interests of the IP are protected.\n\nAccordingly, based on the foregoing, itis hereby\n\nORDERED, that the within Order to Show Cause dated May 23, 2012, is denied in its\nentirety; and it is further\n\nORDERED, that the Department of Social Services, the Intervening Respondent’s relief, as\nrequested in its Answer, dated June 14, 2012, is denied, without prejudice to renew, under papers\nsubmitted in proper format.\n\nThis constitutes the Decision and Order of the Court.\n\nENTER\n\n\n\nKathy J.

You have told Buyer that you have the right to receive certain\npayments due under that Settlement Agreement.\n\nIn connection with that Settlement Agreement, an insurance company agreed to\nmake the settlement payments now due to you. In turn, that insurance company\nairanged for the purchase of an Annuity Policy so that certain settlement payments\nwould be made on an agreed schedule.\n\nBecause the settlement payments are funded by an annuity, your risk of not getting\npaid by the insurance company is low. However, those settlement payments will be\nmade in the future, on a schedule that may no longer meet your needs.\n\nAccordingly, and after considering other ways of raising current cash, you have\ndecided that you want fo sell some (or all) of your settlement payments. simply\nstated, you now want to give up the right to receive certain future settlement\npayments in a trade for a lump-sum cash payment from Buyer.\n\nTHEREFORE:\n\nT,\n\nThe Sale: You agree to sell and Buyer agrees to buy the settlement payments\nidentified as the “Assigned Payments" at the very end of this Agreement.

If you\nelect to be paid by some other means any charges imposed by the bank or\nmoney transfer service will be deducted from your purchase price.\n\nCourt Approval: A court must approve your sale of payments before the Assigned\nPayments can be transferred and monies will be paid fo you. You understand and\nagree that you will not be paid by Buyer until the company that is making the\nsettlement payments has acknowledged receipt of a final court order that: (a)\ncannot be appealed; (b) directs the Annuity Owner and Issuer to make the\n\nPage 1\n\nIOAN A AAssigned Payments to Buyer (or to an entity named by Buyer); and (c) makes all\nfindings required by applicable state and federal law.\n\n4. Best Efforts and Working Together: Buyer agrees to use its best efforts to obtain the\nfequired court approval in an uncontested court proceeding. You agree to\ncooperate with Buyer in that effort and to do all things reasonably necessary to\ncooperate with Buyer in its effort to complete this transaction. Among other things,\nyou agree to promptly provide Buyer with complete and legible copies of the\nSettlement Agreement and the Annuity, as amended and now in effect, and\nexecute such documents which may be necessary to obtain court approval of\nyour sale to Buyer.\n\n5, We Rely Upon What You Tell Us: All facts or statements in this Agreement (including\nany attachments to this Agreement) regarding you, your situation, the payments\nyou are receiving, and the payments you are now selling are based upon\ndocuments and information that you have provided to Buyer. In entering into this\nAgreement, Buyer is relying upon the truth of the statements you have made and\nthe documents you have provided.\n\n6. Your Money, Your Decision: You have fold us that you are 18 years of age or older,\nare of sound mind, not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and understand\nand agree fo the terms of this Agreement. Further, you agree that no one has\nforced you to sign this Agreement nor has anyone promised you anything other\nthan what is stated in this Agreement in an effort to persuade you to sign it.\n\n7. Facts About Your Payments:Buyer must determine whether anyone other than you\nis claiming an interest in the structured settlement payments you are selling us.\nUnless you tell us in writing otherwise, we will assume:\n\n(a) You alone have the tight to receive the Structured Settlement payments\nthat you are now selling and the payments are guaranteed, not life\ncontingent;\n\n(b) Neither you nor anyone else has sold or pledged or otherwise transferred\nthe Assigned Payments nor attempted to do so;\n\n(c) No other person (or business) claims a lien, right, title, or interest of any\nkind in the Assigned Payments;\n\n(4) You are not in bankruptcy;\n\n(e) You are “up to date” in your child support (if any}, alimony {if any), and\ntax payments;\n\nim inn lh10,\n\n(f) There are no unsatisfied judgments or liens against you;\n(9) No lawsuit has been filed or threatened against you or your assets; and\n\n(h) As far as you know, there is no dispute about your right to receive the\nPayments under the Settlement Agreement and no one has challenged\nor threatened to challenge your right to receive those payments.\n\n() The payments you ate now selling are scheduled to be paid to You (or\nyour heirs, beneficiaries, or assigns) whether or not you or some other\nperson is stil ving at the time of payment.\n\nIf one or more of these statements becomes untrue before the Purchase Price is\nPaid to you, you agree to notify Buyer in writing. In all events, you authorize Buyer to\nconduct credit checks and judgment and lien searches to confirm that there are\nno claims against the Assigned Payments.\n\nFacts About Your Life Situation: You have told us that neither you nor those who\ndepend on you rely upon the payments you are now selling for food, shelter,\nmedical care, or the other necessities of life. You understand that you may be\nasked to set forth additional facts about your circumstances and life situation so\nthat the court can better understand your reasons for wanting to sell some or all of\nyour structured settlement payments. Your name, date of birth, marital status,\ncurrent and former addresses, social security number, and other personal\ninformation is fully and truthfully set forth on the application you provided to Buyer.\nYour social security number will not be revealed by us in any public filings.\n\nCertain Debts Paid: Many people choose to sell future settlement payments\nbecause they want to clear up their debts, pay off liens, and bring their past due\nobligations current. if you owe back taxes, past due child support, or have\njudgments or liens recorded against you or your assets, Buyer will review ony such\nobligations with you and determine which debts, claims, or liabilities must be paid\nat the closing. If it is necessary to pay certain debts before funds are released to\nyou, with your consent, Buyer will pay those debts for your account and deduct the\npayment from your Purchase Price.\n\nOther Possible Deductions from the Purchase Price: If some of the payments being\nsold to Buyer under this contract are paid over to you (and not Buyer) before the\nPurchase Price is paid to you, the payments received by you (rather than Buyer) will\nbe deducted "dollar for dollar" from the Purchase Price.\n\n“Holdbacks” While Address Change Is Processed: The insurer making payments\nmay toke several months fo process the change. Accordingly, Buyer may\nwithhold from the Purchase Price: (a) the sum of assigned payments, if any, due tobe received within three to six months following the closing: or {b) 10% of the\nPurchase Price; or (c) $1,000.00, whichever is greater, until the insurer begins to redirect payments to Buyer (or other parties) pursuant to the cour\'’s order or the\ninsurer making the payments confirms in writing the change of payee for the\nAssigned Payments. When the Assigned Payments begin to be received by Buyer\n(or other third parly designated in the order) or the insurer confirms in writing the\nchange of payee, any amounts withheld will be paid over to you, less any\nmonies paid fo you in error while the insurance company was processing the\naddress change.\n\nMisrouted Payments: On rare occasions, even after a court has approved a sale,\nan Assigned Payment may be misrouted or mislabeled by the insurance company.\nIn the event that payments you have sold to Buyer are instead sent to you, you\nagree fo hold those payments in trust and immediately turn them over to Buyer.\nSimilarly, in the event that payments you have sold to Buyer are sent to Buyer but\nmade payable to you, you hereby grant Buyer an irrevocable limited "power of\nattorney" authorizing Buyer to cash any such checks and deposit them to Buyer\'s\ncollection account. In some cases, if the Assigned Payments only constitute a\nportion of your structured settlement payments, the court or your insurance\ncompany may require that the entire structured settlement payment be paid to\nBuyer and Buyer remit the unassigned portion of the structured settlement payment\nback to you. If such a circumstance arises in your transaction, you agree to this\npayment servicing arrangement.\n\nGrant of Security Interest: You intend to sell and Buyer intends to buy your rights in\nand to the "Assigned Payments. " Subject fo the court\'s approval of the sale, you\ngrant to Buyer a “first priority security interest” in the Assigned Payments.\nAccordingly, you agree that Buyer shall have all of the rights of a secured party\nunder the Uniform Commercial Code and may exercise the remedies of a secured\nparty.\n\nChange of Beneficiary: The payments you are selling (the Assigned Payments) are\nto be paid to Buyer in accordance with a set timetable — even if you are no longer\nliving at the fime the payments come due. To confirm that, you will sign and deliver\nto Buyer a change of beneficiary form which designates your estate as the sole\nbeneficiary of the Assigned Payments under the Annuity during the term of the\nAssigned Payments. In addition and to similar effect, this Agreement is and shall be\ndeemed a “Testamentary Agreement” in which you agree, for alll time, to name\nBuyer or its assigns as the party that will inherit the Assigned Payments in the event\nof your death, You cannot and will not amend, modify, alter or otherwise change\nthe beneficiary designation or this Testamentary Agreement without Buyer\'s express\nprior written consent.\n\n\n\nEAA', {'entities': [(364, 382, 'Transfer Company'), (142, 161, 'Transferee')]}), ("IN THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS OF WESTMORELAND COUNTY,\nPENNSYLVANIA\n\nIN RE: PETITION OF MISTY L.

Rodriguez § Harris County, Texas\n\nORDER\n\nAND NOW, this ___ day of January, 2011, upon consideration of the unopposed petition\n(the “Petition”) of RSL Funding, LLC (“RSL Funding” or “Transferee”), the Court hereby finds\nas follows:\n\ni On or about November 1, 2010, Jesus Miguel Rodriguez a/k/a Jesus M.\nRodriguez a/k/a Jesus Rodriguez (“Mr. Rodriguez”) entered into a transfer agreement (the\n“Transfer Agreement”) with Transferee, pursuant to which Mr. Rodriguez agreed to receive\ncertain funds from Transferee in exchange for transferring his right to receive certain structured\nsettlement proceeds, specifically one lump sum payment portion of $175,000.00 due on August\n10, 2020 (the “Assigned Payment”).\n\n2. The transfer as set out in the Application and the Disclosure Statement (as defined\nherein) and in the Transfer Agreement (collectively the “Proposed Transfer”): (i) complies with\nthe requirements of the Texas Structured Settlement Protection Act, Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.\nCode § 141.001 ef seq. (the “Texas Act”) and 26 USC §5891 and does not contravene any other\napplicable laws or the order of any court; (ii) wholly satisfies the requirements of a “qualified\norder” under Internal Revenue Code Section 5891(b); (iii) does not contravene any Federal or\nState statute or the order of any court or responsible government administrative authority and\ncomplies with applicable laws; and (iv) is in Mr. Rodriguez's best interests, taking into account\n\nthe welfare and support of Mr. Rodriguez’s dependents, of which there are none.FRS-Se—aa24\n\n3. Venue and Jurisdiction are appropriate in this Court because this is a court in the\ncounty in which Mr, Rodriguez resides as required under 26 USC § 5891 and Section 141.002(2)\nof the Texas Act.\n\n4, At least three days prior to the date on which Mr. Rodriguez signed the Transfer\n‘Agreement, RSL Funding provided Mr. Rodriguez with the separate Disclosure Statement in\naccordance with the requirements of Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 141.003 (the “Disclosure\nStatement”).\n\n5. Mr. Rodriguez has been advised by RSL Funding, in writing, to seek independent\nprofessional advice regarding the Proposed Transfer, and has either received or waived such\nadvice in writing.\n\n6. RSL Funding has timely filed and served upon all interested parties, including\nLM Property and Casualty Insurance Company f/k/a Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance\nCompany (LM Property) and The Prudential Insurance Company of America (“Prudential”)\n(“LM Property” and “Prudential” are referred to collectively herein as “Insurers”), notice of the\nProposed Transfer as required by Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 141.006(b).\n\n7. Mr. Rodriguez is single and therefore no spousal consent to the Proposed Transfer\nis required.\n\n8. The Transfer Agreement between Mr. Rodriguez and RSL Funding provides that,\nif Mr, Rodriguez is domiciled in this State, any disputes between the parties will be governed in\naccordance with the laws of this State and that the domicile state of Mr. Rodriguez is the proper\nvenue to bring any cause of action arising out of the breach of the Transfer Agreement.\n\n9. RSL Funding assigned all its interest in its right to acquire the Assigned\n\nPayment to RSL-SB-IL, Ltd, (“RSL” or “Assignee”).\n\nPage 2\nEON 748311.17es—sse—a222\n\n\n\n10. Neither LM Property, Prudential, RSL Funding, nor RSL, their successors and\nassigns, and Mr. Rodriguez have presented any evidence that the Assigned Payment (as defined\nherein) has been previously transferred, sold, assigned, encumbered, hypothecated, or otherwise\npledged, and Mr. Rodriguez represents and warrants that Mr. Rodriguez has all rights, title, and\ninterest in the Assigned Payment with full authority to make this transfer to RSL Funding and\nRSL and that Mr. Rodriguez has not otherwise transferred, sold, assigned, encumbered,\nhypothecated, or pledged the Assigned Payment.\n\nBased upon the foregoing findings, and being satisfied that the Proposed Transfer\nsatisfies all applicable statutory requirements as set forth in the Texas Transfer Act, the Proposed\nTransfer is hereby APPROVED. It is therefore ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED\nthat:\n\nUntil the due date of the last Assigned Payment, the designated beneficiary under annuity\ncontract no.

HOLTMAN\n\n\n\nFINAL ORDER\n\n‘The Court, having reviewed and considered the Joint Petition for Approval of Transfer\n(the “Petition”) of Khan Phu Funding, LLC (the “Transferee”) together with all other such\nrelevant matters, finds based upon both 26 U.S.C. § 5891 and 40 P.S, Sec. 4002 et seq, (the\n“Act”), that there is good cause to approve the transfer of structured settlement payment rights by\nand between Rita Ann Holtman, AKA Rita Imm (the “Payee”) and Transferee.\n\nThe court finds as follows:\n\n1. Payee executed a Transfer and Assignment Agreement (the “Transfer\nAgreement”), in which Payee agreed to sell, transfer and assign the right to receive the following\n\npayments: Two Hundred Twenty (220) monthly payments each in the amount of $500.00beginning with the payment due on or about January 07, 2020 continuing through and including\nthe payment due on or about April 07, 2038; ( the "Assigned Payments").\n\n2. ‘The transfer of the structured settlement proceeds as described in the Petition and\nthe Transfer Agreement between Payee and Transferee (the “Proposed Transfer”) does not\ncontravene; (i) other applicable Federal or State statutes or regulations or any applicable law\nlimiting the transfer of workers’ compensation claims; and (ii) any statute or the order of any\ncourt, responsible administrative authority or other government authority.\n\n3. Not less than ten (10) days prior to the date on which the Payee first incurred any\nobligation with respect to the Proposed Transfer, the Transferee has provided to the Payee a\ndisclosure statement satisfying the requirements of the Act.\n\n4. The Payee has established that the Proposed Transfer is in the best interests of the\nPayee or his dependents, if any.\n\n5. The Payee has received or expressly waived in a separate written\nacknowledgment signed by the Payee, independent legal advice regarding the implications of the\nProposed Transfer, including consideration of the tax ramifications of the Proposed Transfer.\n\n6. If the Proposed Transfer would contravene the terms of the structured settlement\nagreement, the express written approvals have been properly obtained and filed, as set forth in\nthe Act.\n\n7. Proper and timely notices were given to all interested parties, including Payee, the\nMetLife Tower Resources Group, Inc. (the “Annuity Owner”) and Metropolitan Life Insurance\nCompany (the “Annuity Issuer”) (Annuity Issuer and Annuity Owner are now collectively\nteferred to as “Insurers”) in full compliance with the Act.\n\n8. Jurisdiction and venue are proper for this Court in accordance with the Act.9. The Proposed Transfer satisfies all requirements of the Act and 26 U.S.C. 5891.\nAccordingly, it is hereby ordered that, that:\nA. The Proposed Transfer is approved.\nB. The Assigned Payments pursuant to the Transfer Agreement are to be made\npayable to Transferee’s designated assignee SOF Receivables III, LLC (the “Assignee”).\nC. The Insurers are hereby directed to deliver and make payable to Assignee at the\nfollowing address:\nSOF Receivables III, LLC\nP.O. Box 200307\nPittsburgh, PA 15251-0307\nTax ID #32-0487898\n(the "Designated Address")\n\nD. The Insurers are hereby directed to acknowledge in writing the remittance\nthe Assigned Payments to Transferee’s Assignee. The written acknowledgement shall be directed\nto Seneca One, LLC, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Suite 1000, Bethesda, MD 20814.\n\nE, This Order does not modify or negate the ownership or control of the\nunderlying annuity contract owner by Annuity Owner, but it does effect Payee’s right to receive\nthe Assigned Payments.\n\nF. The Payee shall no longer have the power or authority to request changes\nof address or beneficiary designation relating to the Assigned Payments, and no person or entity\nother than Transferee or Assignee shall have the power or authority to change the address for\npayment of the Assigned Payments.\n\nG. The death of Payee prior to the due date of the last Assigned Payment\n\nshall not affect the transfer of the Assigned Payments from Payee to Assignee.H. The Insurers shall, as to all parties except the Transferee and Assignee, be\ndischarged and released from any and all liability for the Assigned Payments.\n\nL Any further transfer of structured settlement payment rights by the Payee\nmay be made only after compliance with all of the requirements of the Act.\n\nJ. This Order shall be read in conjunction with any prior orders of this Court\nor any other court transferring payments to Transferee and/or Assignee or to any other assignee,\nand the payments transferred herein shall be in addition to payments transferred pursuant to any\nsuch order(s).\n\nK.

The Life-Contingent\nPayments are not due and payable unless Mr. Ginel is alive on the date each such payment is\ndue.\n\n2. The transfer of the structured settlement proceeds, specifically monthly Life\nContingent Payments of $8,964.00, increasing 3% every October 15", commencing on October\n\n81112836215, 2030 through and including September 15, 2043 (the “Assigned Life-Contingent\nPayments”)!, by Mr. Ginel to Structured Asset as described in the Structured Settlement Payment\nRight Purchase and Assignment Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) between Mr. Ginel and\nStructured Asset and in the petition in this matter (the “Proposed Transfer”) (i) does not\n\ncontravene any applicable federal or state statute or the order of any court or other government or\n\n\n\nresponsible administrative authority; and (ii) is in the best interest of Mr. Ginel, taking into\n\n\n\naccount the welfare and support of his dependents, and the transaction, including the discount\nrate used to determine the gross advance amount and the fees and expenses used to determine the\nnet advance amount, is fair and reasonable.\n\n3. Not less than ten days prior to the date on which Mr. Ginel signed the Purchase\nAgreement, Structured Asset provided to Mr. Ginel a disclosure statement in compliance with\nN.Y. Gen. Oblig. § 5-1703.\n\n4. Mr. Ginel has been advised in writing by Structured Asset to seek independent\nprofessional advice regarding the Proposed Transfer and has either received such advice or\n\nknowingly waived such advice in writing.\n\n\n\nThe Proposed Transfer complies with the requirements of the Structured\nSettlement Protection Act, N.Y. Gen. Oblig. § 5-1701 ef seq., and 26 U.S.C. § 5891, and does\nnot contravene other applicable law.\n\n6. The Purchase Agreement and all disclosures are written in plain language and in\n\ncompliance with N.Y. Gen. Oblig. § 5-702.\n\n| The monthly payments may vary from the actual monthly payments scheduled to be paid under the subject annuity\nbecause of rounding. Structured Asset and Income Stream Funding Partners, LLC agree to accept and Allstate Life\nInsurance Company of New York agrees to pay the actual amount that is due under the subject annuity during the\ntime period described herein. The Superintendent of Financial Services of the State of New York, as Liquidator of\nIdeal Mutual Insurance Company, agrees to and does not object to said payments.\n\n\n\n8111253627. Structured Asset has filed with the Court and timely served on all interested\nparties, including the Superintendent of Financial Services of the State of New York, as\nLiquidator of Ideal Mutual Insurance Company (“Ideal Mutual”), and Allstate Life Insurance\nCompany of New York (“Allstate Life NY”), notice of the Proposed Transfer, a copy of the\nPurchase Agreement, a copy of the disclosure statement and proof of notice of the disclosure\nstatement, and a listing of Mr. Ginel’s dependents, in compliance with the requirements of N.Y.\nGen. Oblig. § 5-1705(c) and (4).\n\n8. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to N.Y. Gen. Oblig. § 51705(b).\n\n9. Structured Asset has assigned to Income Stream Funding Partners, LLC (“Income\nStream”) all of its interest under the Purchase Agreement, including the right to receive the\nAssigned Life-Contingent Payments.\n\nBased upon the foregoing findings, IT Is HEREBY ORDERED that:\n\n1. Pursuant to N.Y, Gen. Oblig. § 5-1706, the Proposed Transfer is approved.\n\n2. Subject to all of the conditions set forth herein and in the parties’ Stipulation\n(“Stipulation”), Allstate Life NY shall forward the Assigned Life-Contingent Payments, within 7\ndays of the date due, by check made payable to “Income Stream Funding Partners, LLC,” c/o\nSecurity Title Agency, 3636 N Central Avenue, Suite 140, Phoenix, AZ 85012 (Account\n981101650) (the “Designated Address”), as follows: monthly Life-Contingent Payments of\n$8,964.09, increasing 3% every October 15", commencing on October 15, 2030 through and\nincluding September 15, 2043.\n\n3. The obligation to make any of the Life-Contingent Payments ceases on Mr.\n\nGinel’s death. Nothing in the subject petition, the Proposed Transfer, the parties’ Stipulation or\n\n811125362any other matter changes the fact that each of the Life-Contingent Payments, including the\nAssigned Life-Contingent Payments, is owed only if Mr. Ginel is alive on the date each such\npayment is due.\n\n4, Beginning ninety (90) days prior to the due date of the first of the Assigned LifeContingent Payments, and every ninety (90) days thereafter and at any time upon reasonable\nrequest of Allstate Life NY, until the due date of the last Assigned Life-Contingent Payment,\nStructured Asset and/or Income Stream shall provide Allstate Life NY with written confirmation,\ncontemporaneously signed by Mr. Ginel and notarized, that Mr. Ginel is alive (the “Required\nConfirmation”). Each Required Confirmation will be sent to the attention of Charmaine\nRasavong, Allstate Life Insurance Company, 3100 Sanders Rd, M3, Northbrook, IL 60062 (or\nsuch other Allstate Life NY representative and/or address subsequently designated by Allstate\nLife NY in a written notice to Structured Asset and Income Stream). Mr. Ginel, Structured\nAsset, and Income Stream shall cooperate with one another and with Allstate Life NY for the\npurpose of providing each Required Confirmation. In the event Structured Asset and/or Income\nStream acquires information indicating that Mr. Ginel has died, Structured Asset and/or Income\nStream shall immediately provide Allstate Life NY with this information in writing directed to\nAllstate Life NY at the address listed above (or to any designated successor Allstate Life NY\nrepresentative or address).\n\n5. If Structured Asset and/or Income Stream fail to provide the Required\nConfirmation that Mr. Ginel is alive, or if Allstate Life NY has any reasonable basis to believe\nthat Mr. Ginel has died, Allstate Life NY may cease making the Life-Contingent Payments,\nincluding the Assigned Life-Contingent Payments, until Allstate Life NY has received the\n\nRequired Confirmation of Mr. Ginel’s survival.\n\n\n\n8111253626. To the extent any of the Life-Contingent Payments are made by Allstate Life NY\nto Income Stream after the death of Mr. Ginel, Income Stream will reimburse Allstate Life NY\nwith funds in the amount of such Life-Contingent Payments, plus interest at 6% per annum from\nthe date the funds were paid through the date reimbursement is tendered.\n\n7. Income Stream is authorized to make subsequent assignments or transfers of the\nAssigned Life-Contingent Payments (a “Reassignment”) except that, regardless of any such\nReassignment, the Assigned Life-Contingent Payments will continue to be serviced by Income\nStream (or an agent on its behalf). In other words, the Assigned Life-Contingent Payments will\ncontinue to be made by Allstate Life NY to Income Stream at the Designated Address only,\nregardless of any Reassignment. However, if for reasons beyond the control of Income Stream,\nor due to Income Stream being merged with or acquired by another entity, or for traditional\naddress change purpose the Designated Address is no longer valid (e., if Income Stream moves\nor for other reasons the Designated Address is no longer a viable address for Income Stream to\nreceive payments), Allstate Life NY agrees to make the Assigned Life-Contingent Payments to a\nnew payment address. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Order and the parties’ Stipulation\nwill remain binding and fully enforceable against Income Stream, Structured Asset, and Mr.\nGinel.\n\n8, All remaining Life-Contingent Payments (and/or portions thereof), if any, that are\nnot the subject of the Proposed Transfer and not previously assigned, shall be made payable to\nMr. Ginel and will be forwarded by Allstate Life NY, if and when due, to Mr. Ginel’s most\nrecent known address or any payment address designated by Mr. Ginel, subject to the consent of\n\nAllstate Life NY and Ideal Mutual.\n\n\n\n8111283629. Structured Asset and Income Stream shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless\nAllstate Life NY and Ideal Mutual and their respective directors, shareholders, officers, agents,\nemployees, servants, successors, and assigns, and any parent, subsidiary, or affiliate thereof, and\ntheir directors, shareholders, officers, agents, employees, servants, successors, and assigns, past\nand present, from and against any and all liability, including but not limited to costs and\nreasonable attorneys’ fees, for any and all claims asserted by any person or entity, including but\nnot limited to any claims asserted by any person or entity not a party hereto, claiming an interest\nin the Assigned Life-Contingent Payments, and any and all other claims made in connection\nwith, related to, or arising out of the Purchase Agreement, the Proposed Transfer, the Assigned\nLife-Contingent Payments, any Reassignment, or Allstate Life NY’s compliance with the\nparties’ Stipulation or Allstate Life NY’s or Ideal Mutual’ s compliance with this Order, except\nwith respect to claims by Structured Asset and Income Stream against Allstate Life NY to\nenforce Allstate Life NY’s obligations to Structured Asset and Income Stream under the parties’\nStipulation, To the extent Structured Asset or Income Stream fails to honor this indemnification\nand defense obligation, Allstate Life NY and Ideal Mutual may, in addition to all other remedies\nafforded by law, satisfy the same by withholding to their own credit any funds owed to Income\nStream or Structured Asset.\n\n10, Allstate Life NY’s lack of opposition to this matter, or its or the other parties’\nstipulation hereto or compliance herewith, shall not constitute evidence in this or any matter, and\nis not intended to constitute evidence in this or any matter, that:\n\n(a) payments under a structured settlement contract or annuity or related\ncontracts can be assigned or that “anti-assignment” or “anti-encumbrance”\nprovisions in structured settlement contracts or annuities or related\ncontracts are not valid and enforceable; or\n\n(b) other transactions entered into by Structured Asset and/or Income Stream\nand their customers constitute valid sales and/or loans; or\n\n-6811128362(©) Allstate Life NY has waived any right in connection with any other\nlitigation or claims; or\n\n(4) Structured Asset or Income Stream has waived any right other than as\nexpressly set forth in the parties’ Stipulation and/or this Order.\n\n11, Structured Asset, Income Stream, and Mr. Ginel, for themselves and for their\nrespective directors, shareholders, officers, agents, employees, servants, successors, heirs,\nbeneficiaries, contingent beneficiaries, executors, administrators, and assigns, and any parent,\nsubsidiary, or affiliate thereof, and their directors, shareholders, officers, agents, employees,\nservants, successors, and assigns, past and present (the “Releasors”), hereby remise, release, and\nforever discharge Allstate Life NY and Ideal Mutual and their respective directors, shareholders,\nofficers, agents, employees, servants, successors, and assigns, and any parent, subsidiary, or\naffiliate thereof, and their directors, shareholders, officers, agents, employees, servants,\nsuccessors, and assigns, past and present (the “Releasees”), of and from any and all manner of\nactions and causes of action, suits, debts, dues, accounts, bonds, covenants, contracts,\nagreements, judgments, settlements, damages, claims, and demands whatsoever, in law or in\nequity, in connection with, related to, or arising out of any claim or allegation that was or could\nhave been asserted in connection with, related to, or arising out of the Purchase Agreement, the\nAssigned Life-Contingent Payments, the Proposed Transfer, any Reassignment or the parties’\nStipulation, which the Releasors have or had from the beginning of the world through the date of\nthis Order, except for claims of the Releasors against the Releases to enforce the Releasees”\nobligations to the Releasors, if any, under the parties’ Stipulation.\n\n12. _ Inconsideration for the Assigned Life-Contingent Payments, Mr. Ginel shall\nreceive from Structured Asset the sum of $95,000.00, minus any agreed upon advances or\n\ndeductions, if any.\n\n\n\n81112536213.

J have personal knowledge of the facts\nstated in this Affidavit and all such facts are true and correct. I am a resident of the County of Harris and\nthe State of Texas.\n\n2... Along with-Settlement Capital Corporation (“SCC”), I am a party in the above-referenced\nproceeding. Ihave been advised by SCC of my right to hire a lawyer to represent me in this proceeding,\nI will independently decide whether or not to obtain advice from a lawyer or other independent\nprofessional advisor regarding the legal, tax, financial and other aspects of this transaction.\n\n3. Tam not married and have no dependents. I would like to complete this transaction to\ncatch up on bills and pay for living expenses while I look for a new job. 1 believe it will be beneficial to\nme if I am permitted to transfer and assign my right to receive the Assigned Payments to SCC as\ndescribed in the Application, Transfer Agreement, and this Affidavit. I believe the transfer of my right to\nreceive the Assigned Payments is in my best interest. I do not believe that approval of this transfer will\nnegatively affect the standard of living for me, make it difficult for me to pay living expenses, or\notherwise harm me in any way. The payments in question are my property and being able to complete\n\nthis transaction will be beneficial to me.\n\nAFFIDAVIT - Page 17S6—-37—4359\n\n\n\n\n\n4. My husband was in a car accident, which resulted in a Settlement Agreement. The\nSettlement Agreement provided for certain periodic payments. In accordance with the Settlement, the\nobligation to make Settlement Payments was assigned to and assumed by Owner (defined as the party that\nhas the continuing obligation to provide the Settlement Payments to Seller under the Settlement\nAgreement or the Qualified Assignment, sometimes referred to as the “Annuity Owner”). The Owner then\npurchased an annuity, contract # 196885 (the “Annuity”), from Presidential Life Insurance Company\n(“Issuer”) in connection with the obligation to make the Settlement Payments to me. I receive my checks\ndirectly from Presidential Life Insurance Company.\n\n5. I signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Transfer Agreement”) with SCC by which I\nagreed to transfer and assign to SCC the right to receive certain of the Settlement Payments due and\npayable in connection with the Settlement and related Annuity as follows:\n\nFive (5) annual payments in the amount of Ten Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($10,000.00) due\nand payable each March 15th, commencing March 2015 and continuing on March 15th of each year\nthereafter through and including March 2019\n(The payments to be assigned to SCC pursuant to the Transfer Agreement shall hereafter be referred to as\nthe “Assigned Payments”)\n\n6. In retum for agreeing to transfer and assign to SCC the Assigned Payments, SCC has\nagreed to pay me a lump sum payment of Eighteen Thousand Five Hundred and No/100 Dollars\n($18,500.00), to be paid directly to me or, at my direction, to be paid to others for my benefit.\n\n7 A Disclosure Statement was provided to me by SCC and I received at least three (3) days\nbefore the date I signed the Transfer Agreement. I have read this Disclosure Statement and understand\nwhat it means. I was advised by SCC, in writing, to seek independent professional advice regarding the\ntransaction.\n\n8.

Â§ AT LAW NUMBER THREE\nÂ§\nÂ§\nSOUTHERN PREPARATORY Â§\nACADEMY Â§ HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS\n\nFINAL JUDGMENT\n\nOn the 25th day of March, 2015, came on to be heard the above entitled and numbered cause,\nwherein Tiffany Knox as next friend of Anthony Lenette, a Minor, are Plaintiffs, and Southern\nPreparatory Academy is the Defendant.\n\nâ\x80\x98The Plaintiffs appeared in person and through their attorney of record; and Anthony Lenette,\nminor, appeared in person and by Edward J. Mahar, a member in good standing of the State Bar of\nTexas, heretofore appointed Guardian Ad Litem by the Court. Defendant appeared by attomey of\nrecord. All parties announced to the Court that an agreement for settlement for the Minor Plaintiff\nhad been reached between the Plaintiffs and Defendant, without any admission of liability on the part\nof the Defendant, under the terms of which certain money payments would be paid to the minor\nPlaintiff in full, complete and final settlement of all claims asserted by minor Plaintiff as to the\nDefendant, Southern Preparatory Academy .\n\nWhereupon, the Court proceeded to hear evidence in support of said Agreement for\nSettlement, both with respect to the questions of liability and the questions of damages, and the\nCourt having considered the settlement reached between the parties, and the Court having been\nsatisfied from the evidence presented that the Settlement Agreement between the parties is in all\n\nthings reasonable, fair and just, and in the best interest of the minor Plaintiff; and that the following\n\nPage 1future payments will be made as follows:\n\n1) $10,000 payable to Tiffany Knox and her attorneys, The Payne Firm, PC\n\nfor attomeys fees, costs and expenses;\n\n2) Periodic payments payable to Anthony Lenette:\n\n$3,390.28 Semi-annually, guaranteed for four (4) years, beginning on July\n1, 2025. The last payment will be made on January 2, 2029.\n\nThe obligation to make the periodic payments described herein may be assigned to Pacific\nLife and Annuity Services, Inc. and funded by an annuity contract issued by Pacific Life. Such\nannuity is more fully described in the Settlement Agreement and Release. The Court finds that said\nannuity meets all the requirements of Section 142.001, et seq., Texas Property Code, and approves\nsaid annuity for the purpose of funding a portion of the settlement set out herein. The Court finds that\nsaid annuity contracts have been or will be purchased by Scottsdale Insurance Company at a total\n\ncost of $20,000.00.\n\nIt is further Ordered that once payment is made as set forth above, the qualified assignments\nhave been executed, the annuity is funded and the annuity contract to Minor Plaintiff, Anthony Lenette,\nhas been issued, Defendant, Southern Preparatory Academy, shall be fully relieved and discharged\nfrom this judgment and all liability, claims, demands and causes of action whatsoever asserted in the\n\nabove referenced cause of action.\n\nIt is further Ordered that the rights to receive periodic payments granted to the minor Plaintiff\nin this Judgment may not be sold, transferred, hypothecated, pledged,, or otherwise alienated in any\nmanner, directly or indirectly, without the prior approval of the then-sitting Judge of this Court, as\nevidenced by an order approving such transaction entered after compliance with all requirements of the\nStructured Settlement Protection Act, Section 141.001, Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code, as it\n\nnow exists or may hereafter be amended, or any successor to such statute. Any purported or attempted.\n\nPage 2sale, transfer, hypothecation, pledge, or other alienation of such payment rights that has not been so\n\napproved will be a direct violation of this Order.\n\nIt is, therefore ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED that Plaintiffs, Tiffany Knox, as\nnext friend of Anthony Lenette, have and recover from Southern Preparatory Academy, the amounts\nset forth above and set forth in the Settlement Agreement and Release, which Settlement Agreement\nand Release having been signed by the Plaintiffs, and the Defendant, by and through its attomey of\nrecord, and which Settlement Agreement and Release is here and now specifically approved by the\n\nCourt.\n\nThe Court is further of the opinion that the written Settlement Agreement and Release\nbetween the Minor Plaintiff and Defendants and specifically approved by the Court, is fair and\n\nreasonable in all respects to the Minor Plaintiff, particularly to Anthony Lenette, a minor.\n\nIt is further ordered that Edward J.

The Court being fully advised in the premises, it is hereby:\n\nORDERED AND ADJUDGED THAT:\n\n1. The Motion for Approval of Minor Settlement is granted and this Court ratifies and\napproves the settlement in the amount of $15,500.00 reached between First Liberty\nInsurance Corporation and plaintiff, on behalf of the minor, and the settlement in the\namount of $6,500.00 between Miguel Corco and Anne R.
